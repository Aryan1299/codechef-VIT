              CodeChef is a not-for-profit educational initiative by Directi, an
              Indian software company. It is a global programming community that
              fosters learning and friendly competition, built on top of the
              world’s largest competitive programming platform. We have also
              built a large community of problem curators.
            </p>

            <p>
              CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big
              in the world of algorithms, computer programming and programming
              contests. We host three featured contests every month and give
              away prizes and goodies to the winners as encouragement. Apart
              from this, the platform is open to the entire programming
              community to host their own contests. Major institutions and
              organizations across the globe use our platform to host their
              contests. On an average, 30+ external contests are hosted on our
              platform every month.

            <p>
              In Vellore Institute of Technology, CodeChef is a technical
              chapter that helps students all over the campus to improve their
              coding skills. The core committee members of the chapters are
              divided into four areas of expertise- Technical, Projects,
              Management and Design. The main objective is to provide the
              students a platform where they can learn, share and test their
              knowledge. CodeChefVIT keeps conducting several workshops and
              events in order to help the students do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              It all started from the academic year 2015-2016 when CodeChef – A
              Directi Educational Initiative was inaugurated in VIT University
              with Arpit Shringi as President, Raghav Arora as Vice-President
              and Rishabh Chaddha as Joint Secretary with Prof. Murali S. as the
              faculty co-ordinator.
